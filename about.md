# About Me

I’m Samson Orodele, a passionate **Data Scientist & Analyst** dedicated to harnessing data to solve complex problems and drive strategic decisions. With a strong foundation in **database management**, **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **data science**, I specialize in transforming raw data into actionable insights that empower organizations. I love to play football and chess in my free times.

## My Journey

My love for numbers and data motivated me to pursue a master's degree in Data Science at Northumbria University where I graduated with a distinction.  My expertise spans designing robust relational databases, crafting predictive models, and building interactive visualizations. Through projects like creating an [Oracle SQL database for transport management](https://github.com/SamsonOrodele/Travel_Company_Database), developing [machine learning models for breast cancer detection](https://github.com/SamsonOrodele/Breast_Cancer_Classification), and designing [Power BI dashboards for workforce trends](https://github.com/SamsonOrodele/Data_Professional_Survey_PowerBI), I’ve honed a versatile skill set that bridges technical precision with business impact.

## Skills & Tools

- **Database Management**: Oracle SQL, MySQL, schema design, data integrity
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical modeling, exploratory analysis, data preprocessing
- **Machine Learning**: Deep learning (TensorFlow), classification, explainable AI
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Power BI, Excel, Python (Matplotlib), R (ggplot2)
- **Programming**: Python, R, SQL, VBA

## My Mission

I’m driven by a passion for uncovering hidden patterns in data and making insights accessible to all. Whether it’s optimizing logistics, advancing healthcare, or informing business strategy, I aim to deliver solutions that are both innovative and impactful. I’m excited to bring my skills to roles in database management, data analysis, machine learning, and data science, where I can contribute to data-driven success.
